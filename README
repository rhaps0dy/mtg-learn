/Main.elm
This file sets the overall structure of the document and contains main. Also
contains the big Model of the Elm standard architecture. It defines the ports
for executing the Task.Tasks needed

/Components/Tray.elm
Tray in the left side. Also defines view for the buttons that are on its
side. One manipulates whether the tray is open or closed. The other manipulates
fullscreen for the application. This second button deviates a bit from what
should be an Elm button as it manipulates the actual state of the world: it
activates and deactivates fullscreen and needs a port defined somewhere else or
it won't work. The reason for this is browsers blocking fullscreen requests
outside of direct event callbacks from user-initiated events.

/Components/Tray
Components that go in the tray in the left side

/Components/YLabels.elm

/Components/GenericLabel.elm
Functions and data structures common to all labels, such as the Actions and
Models.

/Components/Template.elm
Not really part of the project, but has the boilerplate required to create a new
Component.

/Components/Misc.elm
Miscellaneous component view functions to reuse in other components.
